## HELLO WORLD!!! 

Welcome to my self-taught programming blog. This isn’t just no ordinary blog (it probably is) as you will see some things that you have never seen before (probably not). This blog is a deep dive into my journey where I document my successes, frustrations and projects that I’m working on. All to convince (future employer or future) or inspire (another self-taught legend), that I have the g(r)it to engage in code-combat. 

## Study Medium

A few months ago I had dabbled in web development by following along HeadFirst's “HTML & CSS” textbook. Truth be told I got through the HTML section but dropped the textbook after that... I felt that I needed a voice attached to my learning. A few months later, I picked up the discipline again through a web developer udemy course.

## Tracking study sessions

I decided I needed a way to track my coding sessions. I found a simple google extension called “Simple Time Track” by developer, Ahmet Bora. My current goal is to put in at least 3+ hours a day or 15-20 hours of study and per week. 

I’ve tried other time trackers and productivity apps yet I haven’t found something more simplistic and minimal as this one. It's also free to use and you can export your sessions to an excel spreadsheet if need be:

## Thoughts

In the past 2 weeks, I have come to understand the complexity and how expansive the programming world actually is. Frustrations aside, I'm enjoying the challenge of going deep into something that's worth doing. It's easy to get caught up in internal dialogue so I have to remind myself that doing something everyday, at the very least, is good enough. 

This is my first blog post of many and I hope this has helped you on your own journey.

See you soon, 

Brendan.
