Welcome to my self-taught programming blog. This isn’t just no ordinary blog (it probably is) as you will see some things that you have never seen before (probably not). This blog is a deep dive into my journey where I document my successes, frustrations and projects that I’m working on. All to convince (future employer) or inspire (another self-taught programmer).
